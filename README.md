# write_EOS_table_SWIFT
Convert SESAME-301-style tables to SWIFT-format ANEOS tables. Requires NEW-SESAME-EXT.TXT and NEW-SESAME-STD-NOTENSION.TXT (or NEW-SESAME-STD.TXT). 

Runs out of the box by putting this cloned directory adjacent to the cloned ANEOS directories - otherwise need to change filepath info lines. Currenntly set up for pyrolite.
